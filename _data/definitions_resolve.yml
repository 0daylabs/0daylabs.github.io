identifier_code: "The way the identifier appears in the code that you submit through the REST API call. Ensure case sensitivity matches exactly."

identifier_comparison_method_data_type: "When you compare identifier values, the difference between the two must be quantified. In quantifying the difference between the identifier values, you have can select from among four data types. Different comparison methods allow different data types."

# COMPARISON DATA TYPES
boolean_value: "<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Available for Exact Match and Exists comparison methods only. (The only evaluation to these two comparison methods is whether the identifier values match or not.)"

integer_range: "A max and min range consisting of whole numbers. Available for Exists Hours, Exists Hours Device Profile, Exact Match Devices, and Exact Match Devices comparison methods. In these comparison methods, which involve a time or device count, the difference between the incoming identifier value and existing identifier value is measurable through a number."

decimal_range: "A max and min range of decimals. Available for Exists Hours, Exists Hours Device Profile, Exact Match Devices, and Exact Match Devices. In these comparison methods, which involve a time or device count, the difference between the incoming identifier value and existing identifier value is measurable through a number."

string_range: "A max and min range of strings. Available for the Input Value comparison method only."

identifier_description: "A description for the identifier."

identifier_match_tiers: "When the new identifier value is compared against an existing identifier value, the outcome of the comparison must be quantified. The match tier value can be a boolean (true/false), or a max/min number range (such as a time difference). Within a rule set, you can use different match tiers for the same identifier. (Within a single rule, however, you apply just one match tier per identifier.)" 

identifier_name: "Friendly name for the identifier."

identifier_save_identifier: "Whether to save the identifier value or not. If you have an opt out flag,you may not want to store the identifier value for privacy reasons."

identifier_save_identifier_history_profile: "Each time a match is made, a history count table is updated. This check box allows you to count the number of matches made for the identifier."

# COMPARISON METHODS
exact_match: "Compare to last-seen identifier value. Case sensitivity is enforced."

exists: "Compare to any previous identifier value. Case sensitivity is not enforced."

exists_hours: "Compare to any previous identifier value. The time range between the new identifier  value and the previous identifier value must fall within the time range specified in the match tier."

exists_hours_device_profile: "Compare to any previous identifier value. At least one identifier value within the device profile must have a last-seen date/time that falls within the date/time range defined in the match tier."

exact_match_devices: "Compare to the last-seen identifier value. If the identifier values match (with case sensitivity enforced), a histogram with the predicted number of devices containing this ID is consulted. If the histogram's prediction regarding the number of devices falls within the range defined in the match tier, a match is made."

exact_match_hours: "Compare to the last-seen identifier value. Case sensitivity is enforced. If the identifiers match, the date/time of the incoming identifier value is compared to the date/time of the last-seen identifier value in the device profile. The difference between the two values is compared to the range defined in the match tier. If the difference falls within the match tier's range, a match is made."

input_values: "Compare the identifier's value with match tier values. The identifier's value must match the values in the lower and upper value of the match tier range."


# IDENTIFIER PROPERTIES
identifier_expand: "This check box appears only for JSC, IP Octet, and Country Code identifier types (and only after you save and edit the identifier). You can expand the JSC payload into a DeviceInsight ID. IP identifier values can be expanded into country codes. IP 4 Octets can be expanded to IP 3 Octets, and so on. Latlong identifier values can be expanded into geohashes. After selecting this check box, complete the expansion details for the type of identifier you want to create."

identifier_hash_the_value_prior_to_saving: "Hashing protects the data with a scrambled result to obfuscate PII (personally identifiable information)."

identifier_index: "When new requests are received, the ID service looks in the Index table for matches. If the identifier does not appear in the index, no matches will occur. Although the ID service looks for matches based on the rules, by removing some values from the index table that aren't in your rule set, you can speed up the matching process because there will be fewer items to query."

identifier_ip_profiling: "Includes IP addresses in the identifier history and history count."

identifier_keep_identifier_history: "Keeps a history of all identifier values matched. For example, if the identifier value is an IP address, all the IP addresses matched will be kept in the profile's history. Unchecking this box will prevent AdTruth from matching incoming identifiers with previous identifiers."

identifier_trigger_merge_queue_process: "If selected, when the last-seen identifier value in the profile changes, the merge process will trigger for this identifier, and the ID service will look for other profiles containing the same identifier value. If other profiles are found to contain the same identifier value, these matching profiles (now considered seconary profiles) will be merged into the primary profile. Without this option selected, the  merge process will not be executed for this identifier. Do not select this check box for first-party identifiers (such as Login IDs) or IP addresses. Doing so will result in device profiles that contain multiple devices. To find all profiles that contain the same user, you can use the multiscreen or household endpoints."

# IDENTIFIER TYPES

cookie: "Used by web sites to track visitors over time. Cookies should be globally unique and related to a single browser."

native_device_id: "Used for identifiers that are primarily only available within mobile applications such as Android Id and IDFA."

first_party_id: "Any ID that can be used to identify a single user. It be a (hashed) login ID, user ID, account number, email address, or something else that identifies the user."

tdl: "Stands for Time-Differential Linking. TDL is the difference between the time on the user's computer and the clock on the server."

deviceinsight_isolated: "An ID from a DeviceInsight ISOLATED recipe. ISOLATED recipes are focused on identifying the browser."

deviceinsight_universal: "An ID from a DeviceInsight UNIVERSAL recipe. UNIVERSAL recipes are tailored to identifying the device."

ip_octet: "A 1, 2, 3, or 4 octet IP address. (The other octets in the identifier may be masked.) You can expand IP identifiers into country code identifiers or other IP Octets."

expand_from_jsc: "An ID expanded from a JavaScript Collector (JSC) payload. The JSC is not an identifier in itself but rather used to create an identifier. When you create an identifier from a JSC payload, you are \"expanding\" the payload to get the ID. After you select JSC and save the identifier, edit the JSC identifier. You will see an \"Expand\" check box at the bottom of the Identifier screen. When you select Expand, you can then select the type of identifier you want to create from the JSC payload."

country_code: "The country code in the user's header. Since the country code in a user's header will hardly be unique, you would use this identifier in conjunction with other identifiers in your rule."

latlong: "Latitude and longitude data included in the header of a user session. You can expand Latlong identifiers into geohashes. As with country code, when you configure your rules, you would use Latlong as an identifier in combination with some other identifier."

identifier_use_in_deviceinsight_id_expansion: "Appears only for IP identifiers and is intended to complement JSC expansion. If selected, when the JSC payload is collected, the IP address identifiers included in the submission will factor into the creation of the DeviceInsight ID."

# RULES 

rule_description: "A description for the rule."

rule_identifier_to_match: "You can add as many identifiers to match as you want. Each additional identifier you add creates an \"AND\" condition in the match query. For example, if you add both DeviceInsight ID and IP address, the rule must have matches with both identifiers. If one match fails, the entire rule gets skipped."

rule_lift_denominator: "If you select this check box, the success of this rule (based on number of matches) will form the baseline in reports."

rule_lift_numerator: "If you select this check box, the success of this rule (based on number of matches) will form the ceiling in reports."

rule_match_tier: "Select the match tier that you set up for the identifier. For \"EXACT MATCH\" or \"EXISTS\" comparisons, the match tiers will be booleans (true or false). For comparison methods involving time differences or device counts, the comparison method will be a range with a max and min value."

rule_name: "A name for the rule. Usually the name includes the identifier the rule is evaluating and the comparison method used."

rule_priority: "The order in which the rules are run. Enter a number (for example, `3`) for each rule to set the order. When a rule finds a match, the other rules are skipped (unless they are test-only rules)."

rule_rule_log_prefix: "The logs will contain a prefix indicating the rule executed."

rule_rule_status: "If your rule set is active, you cannot edit it. You must first change the status to inactive before you can make changes."

rule_rule_type: "Device Group rules are evaluated *after* Device rules, and only evaluated if the \"Threshold Number of Profiles That Can Contain This Identifier\" value is exceeded. The Device Group rules will include a flag in the response indicating that the rule is a Device Group rule. Device Groups are a mechanism to prevent you from creating too many device profiles. Responses with the Device Group flag indicate a low-quality device profile."

rule_test_only_rule: "By selecting option, although rules are executed, no profiles will be created."

rule_velocity_limits_for_this_identifier: "After the volume limits you set here are reached, the rule is skipped. If you select \"Matches per day\" and choose 10, then after 10 matches for the identifier, the rule will get skipped. Too many matches could indicate that the rule is poorly formed and not accurately identifying a device."

rule_velocity_limits_value: "The value for the volume limit you selected in the previous selector (for example, <code>10</code>)."

rule_window_key: "The window key is the identifier type concatenated with the value. This key is used to look up profiles from the identifier index table. (Why use the term \"window\"? You're establishing a <i>window</i> for the number of allowed values by setting a threshold for the key.)"

rule_window_key_threshold: "In the index table, each window key can point to various device profiles. You can set a limit to the number of device profiles that each window key is allowed to point to. (In the profile database, however, each profile can contain as many window keys as have been submitted in requests, without limits from the threshold.)"

# RULESETS
ruleset_active: "If your rule set is active, you cannot edit any of the rules. You must clear the Active check box before you can edit your rules. (This is a safety measure.)"

ruleset_default: "Although you can have many rule sets, only one rule set can be used at a time by the ID service to evaluate submissions. Select Default to instruct the ID service to use this rule set."

ruleset_name: "The name of the rule set."

ruleset_sampling_rate: "Used for testing purposes for evaluating test-only rules in the rule set. Enter a percentage (without the % sign). The sampling rate sets the number of requests that are processed using rules that are marked as \"Test Only\" rules. If you enter 50, half the requests received by the ID service will be processed by Test Only rules. The other half of the requests will be processed by the other rules (which aren't marked as Test Only)."

ruleset_version: "Getting your rules just right is usually an iterative process. By labeling your rule set with version numbers, you can easily create variations of your rules and revert to previous versions."

# Household fields

householding_identifier: "The IP address identifier used to get the list of associated device profiles. The identifier must be an IPv4 type identifier."

householding_max_number_of_profiles_matched: "The maximum number of profiles returned containing this identifier. The default is 50. The more profiles you want returned, the greater the time it may take to look through the database."

householding_connection_types_to_exclude: "IP addresses can be categorized in a more granular way: DIALUP, CABLE_DSL, CORPORATE, and CELLULAR. You can exclude the type of IP address you don't want included in the profile matches. If you don't select an option, all types of IP addresses will be included."

# Multiscreen fields

multiscreening_identifier: The first-party identifier used to get the list of associated device profiles. The identifier must be a first-party type identifier.

multiscreening_max_number_of_profiles_matched: "The maximum number of profiles returned containing this identifier. The default is 50. The more profiles you want returned, the greater the time it may take to look through the database."
